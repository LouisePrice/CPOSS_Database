## CSP Studies
This work was carried out in collaboration with Susan Reutzel-Edens and Rajni Miglani-Bhardwaj when they were working at Eli Lilly and the University of Strathclyde, respectively.  A rigid molecule MOLPAK search was carried out in 2010, but this has not been published.  This is called search B.  A flexible CrystalPredictor search was carried out in 2013.  This is called search A.
There were second derivative properties which could not be uploaded to the database, but the free energy corrections derived from these could.
