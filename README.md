# CPOSS_Database
This is the legacy repository for all CPOSS CSP landscapes.

I'm just going to try and write something with html to see if it works.

<table border="1"><tr><td bgcolor="red">This is supposed to be a red table cell</td></tr></table>

## Molecule Information

There will be a table, outlined in black, describing the general information about the molecule.

<table class="molTable"><tr><td>REFCODE</td><td>The refcode of the molecule will appear here</td><td>There will usually be a link to download the Word Document</td></tr></table>

## Search Information

Then there will be tables about the searches that were carried out.  Each search has a search identifier (A, B, C, etc.) and can have multiple energy models (1, 2, 3, etc.).  Different searches have different colour outlines, and different energy models are separated by horizontal rules.

<table class="searchATable"><tr><td>Search Identifier</td><td>A</td><td>There will usually be a link to the overall spreadsheet and the chemiscope file.</td></tr></table>
